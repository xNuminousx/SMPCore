# SMP Core
The core plugin for my SMP (survival multiplayer) server. This is an experimental project where I try new things and develop myself as a coder.

## What's Included

**REPORTING**: This reporting system utilizes menus and chat for easy reporting on anything. Using the `/report` command will bring up the menu to get you started. After created, the report is stored for staff review. The plug-in will inform staff when a report is made and remind them at log-in if there are unresolved reports.

Staff can view unresolved reports in a menu or in the chat with `/report newest`. Resolve reports by right-clicking it in a menu or with `/report delete`.

**EFFECTS**: These are just particle animations that follow players around. I use these to experiment with different animations.

**WANDS**: The wands are going to serve as an extension to minecraft potion making. I intend for there to be a wand for each potion variant. Each wand is craftable, for which the recipe ingredients will mimic what is required to make the respective potion. Lots of potential for development here.

**FAMILIARS**: As a sort of add-on to the wand idea, you can conjure a companion to follow you around the world. Eventually there will be different types of familiars that can have different benefits to the player. Such as healing, fighting, speed, etc.

**GAME**: This mini-game system will put contributing players into a joinable PvP match. The game can be tracked and manipulated with commands or menus. I intend for the game concept to become more of an API than a hardcoded system so that multiple games can easily be created and elaborated upon. For instance, I'm currently planning out a Mob Battle game.

*Some features of this plugin are hardcoded to work only on my specific server. Some features are also incomplete and experimental. Use at your own risk...*
